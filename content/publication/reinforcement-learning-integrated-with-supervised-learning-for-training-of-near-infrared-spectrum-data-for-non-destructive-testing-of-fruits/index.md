summary: A machine learning algorithm combining reinforcement learning and
  supervised learning is demonstrated for training of near infrared spectroscopy
  data for non-destructive measurement of fruit quality. The model optimizes the
  combination of pretreatment methods, discriminant methods and calibration
  methods and also the parameters used in the methods to achieve highest
  prediction correlations. The model achieves better results than manual
  combinations of the previously demonstrated models.
