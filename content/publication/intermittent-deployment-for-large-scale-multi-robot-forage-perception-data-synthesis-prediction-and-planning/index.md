summary: Monitoring the health and vigor of grasslands is vital for informing
  management decisions to optimize rotational grazing in agriculture
  applications. To take advantage of forage resources and improve land
  productivity, we require knowledge of pastureland growth patterns that is
  simply unavailable at state of the art. In this paper, we propose to deploy a
  team of robots to monitor the evolution of an unknown pastureland environment
  to fulfill the above goal. To monitor such an environment, which usually
  evolves slowly, we need to design a strategy for rapid assessment of the
  environment over large areas at a low cost. Thus, we propose an integrated
  pipeline comprising of data synthesis, deep neural network training and
  prediction along with a multi-robot deployment algorithm that monitors
  pasturelands intermittently. Specifically, using expert-informed agricultural
  data coupled with novel data synthesis in ROS Gazebo, we first propose a new
  neural network architecture to learn the spatiotemporal dynamics of the
  environment. Such predictions help us to understand pastureland growth
  patterns on large scales and make appropriate monitoring decisions for the
  future. Based on our predictions, we then design an intermittent multi-robot
  deployment policy for low-cost monitoring. Finally, we compare the proposed
  pipeline with other methods, from data synthesis to prediction and planning,
  to corroborate our pipeline's performance.
