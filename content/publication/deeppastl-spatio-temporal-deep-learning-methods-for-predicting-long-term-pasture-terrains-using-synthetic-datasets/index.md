summary: Effective management of dairy farms requires an accurate prediction of
  pasture biomass. Generally, estimation of pasture biomass requires
  site-specific data, or often perfect world assumptions to model prediction
  systems when field measurements or other sensory inputs are unavailable.
  However, for small enterprises, regular measurements of site-specific data are
  often inconceivable. In this study, we approach the estimation of pasture
  biomass by predicting sward heights across the field. A convolution based
  sequential architecture is proposed for pasture height predictions using deep
  learning. We develop a process to create synthetic datasets that simulate the
  evolution of pasture growth over a period of 30 years. The deep learning based
  pasture prediction model (DeepPaSTL) is trained on this dataset while learning
  the spatiotemporal characteristics of pasture growth. The architecture purely
  learns from the trends in pasture growth through available spatial
  measurements and is agnostic to any site-specific data, or climatic
  conditions, such as temperature, precipitation, or soil condition. Our model
  performs within a 12% error margin even during the periods with the largest
  pasture growth dynamics. The study demonstrates the potential scalability of
  the architecture to predict any pasture size through a quantization approach
  during prediction. Results suggest that the DeepPaSTL model represents a
  useful tool for predicting pasture growth both for short and long horizon
  predictions, even with missing or irregular historical measurements.
